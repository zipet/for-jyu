# Public facing.

Hey! This is my public facing Github repository. In here i will push stuff that i have completed and/or is in somewhat working state.

## Code_advent

These are my attempts on the coding puzzles Advent of Code of 2022. I used python to write these because python is the language i'm most comfortable with.<br>
I have the basics down with C#, but most of the experience i have is with python.
